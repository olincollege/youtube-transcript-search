[Kat Canavan](https://katcanavan.com) and [Brooke Moss](https://www.brookem.dev) are two college students at Olin College of Engineering who are both engaged with *Nerdfighteria*, an  online community hosted by John and Hank Green, primarily hosts of the YouTube channel *[Vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers)*, as well as many other endeavors including the educational YouTube channels *[CrashCourse](https://www.youtube.com/c/crashcourse)* and *[SciShow](https://www.youtube.com/user/scishow?)*.

Since channels like this have collected a mountainous amount of content over the years, and community members on forums are often found struggling to find a part of a specific video they can't remember the title of, we wondered if we could create a search function using YouTube video transcripts so that the words spoken in a video could be easily searched.

While our initial idea was to make a tool to search Nerdfighteria related channels, we quickly decided to expand the functionality to any YouTube channel.

We're currently very pleased with our initial terminal implementation and in the future we'd love to make a web-based version to be more accessible to the the wider public.
